# Reinforcement learning for Kuka Robotic arm manipulation task

Pybullet Kuka robotic arm manipulation task was analyzed for different reinforcement learning algorithms. Following approaches were considered for the task.

- DQN (discrete action space)
- A2C
- DDPG
- PPO

The PPO and DDPG implementation were augmented with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER). In addition to this, curiosity driven exploration was studied for DDPG implementation
